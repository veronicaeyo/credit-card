# credit-card-fraud

Credit card fraud is a major concern for banks and financial institutions. Fraudsters use
various techniques to steal credit card information and make unauthorized transactions. In
this project, we will explore a dataset containing credit card transactions and build models
to predict fraudulent transactions.

This dataset was downloaded fom this [link]https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection on kaggle.com

This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

### Source of Simulation

This was generated using Sparkov Data Generation | Github tool created by Brandon Harris. This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. The files were combined and converted into a standard format.

### Context

In this project, we will start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a better
understanding of the data. Next, we will perform data processing and modeling, where we
will build several classification models to predict fraudulent transactions. We will also
address the issue of imbalanced classes by using undersampling. Finally, we will evaluate
the performance of the models and choose the best one based on various evaluation
metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

### Acknowledgements

Brandon Harris for his amazing work in creating this easy-to-use simulation tool for creating fraud transaction datasets.
